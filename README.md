If you're just trying the bot out, start it via ``racket
freenode-main.rkt``.  If you want it to run continuously, and happen
to have [upstart](http://upstart.ubuntu.com/) available (which in
practice means you're running Ubuntu), you can copy ``rudybot.conf``
to ``/etc/init`` and then ``# start rudybot``.

Getting an error about ``rackunit`` not being available?  That can be
caused by using the ``racket-textual`` package instead of ``racket``.

Run the tests like this:

    $ raco test -x .

Unfortunately, you'll have to pay attention to the output of ``raco
test``, since it will likely exit with 0 status even if some of the
tests fail.  This is IMHO a misfeature of ``raco test``; the Racket
developers seem disinclined to change it (see
[this bug report](http://bugs.racket-lang.org/query/?cmd=view&pr=13573)).
