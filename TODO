* Find a sensible way to run tests
"crude-test-runner" is just that: crude.  It doesn't notice if a
subtest fails.  Perhaps the recent (March 2012) chatter about
"submodules" on the racket mailing list
(http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.racket.devel/5582) points to
a solution (have each .rkt file define a submodule named "tests", and
use some as-yet-nonexistent test runner that finds and runs all such
submodules).

* Roll the log file over
that is, don't let it grow without bound, but instead, once it gets to
a certain size, rename it and start a new file.

It might be easiest to invoke "multilog" from Dan Bernstein's
"daemontools" (http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/daemontools-0.76.tar.gz ;
available on Ubuntu 10.04 in the "daemontools" package)

* Get rid of "in/on" in the output of the "seen" command
surely I can figure out which preposition is appropriate.

* Run with "--warn info"
... and fix the various lint-like warnings that come up

* Put the persistent data someplace safe
That's the big-log (which we mine for incubot-witticisms) and the
userinfo db.  I keep accidentally deleting them, and losing months of
accumulated data; they should be on S3 or something.

Someone suggested Dropbox; that could work!

* Incubot
** Publish the last few "logs"

For example, if someone says to him "you are clever" and he responds
"I have a clever idea", there'll be messages like "incubot chose
'clever'" in the log output ... make those messages accessible via
HTTP so that people can tell why he said what he said.

** A 'censor' command
defverb #:master (censor objectionable_words) ...

would eliminate rows in the incubot db that contain those words.

delete from log_word_map where rowid in ( select log_word_map.log_id from log_word_map where word in 
        (objectionable_words) );
delete from log_word_map where word in (objectionable_words) ;
delete from word_popularity where word in (objectionable_words) ;

Also note that this will leave ghosts in log_word_map -- references to
the deleted rows from "log".  This will nix those:

        DELETE FROM log_word_map
              WHERE log_id IN (
                 SELECT log_id 
                   FROM log_word_map 
              LEFT JOIN log 
                     ON log.rowid = log_word_map.log_id
          WHERE text IS NULL );

Note that such a command would be insanely dangerous; if I
accidentally typed "censor the", I'd lose most of the corpus, since
most log entries contain the word 'the'.

** Omit leading nicks from utterances
The original incubot does this.  E.g., if we find
: ":offby1!n=user@pdpc/supporter/monthlybyte/offby1 PRIVMSG #scheme :rudybot: seen eli"
in the log, then we currently reduce that to
: "rudybot: seen eli"
but we should really omit the leading nick and colon, yielding
: "seen eli"
That's because it looks odd for the bot to utter something that's
directed at someone who probably isn't present.
** Entirely omit, or at least trim, ACTION
I just saw the bot respond with "\1ACTION does something or other\1",
which was weird; it should have either said nothing, or else just
"does something or other".
** Use the same logic ...
... to initially create "parsed-log", as to add individual utterances
to it.

For example, I'm pretty sure I omit utterances that are addressed to
the bot, and begin with a command; i.e., when jordanb says "rudybot:
quote", I don't add that, since it'd be dull.

And yet when log-parser creates parsed-log, it blithely adds
everything.

** Underweight recent utterances

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
<jordanb> Offby1 should make a lolbot.
<offby1> already did
<jordanb> Heh
<jordanb> Have it join. ^_^
<jordanb> rudybot: lol
<rudybot> jordanb: lol
<jordanb> rudybot: lolbot                                                                                           [16:19]
<rudybot> jordanb: Offby1 should make a lolbot.
<jordanb> O                                                                                                         [16:21]
* offby1 makes a mental note to underweight recent utterances
<jordanb> I'm using emacs over X because it's less broken than tramp.

* Replace minion

<jcowan> Having IRC-based messaging is very nice
<jcowan> I like phenny-style:  "rudybot: ask/tell <user> <message>", where the user is case insensitive
         and ignores underscores.

This is also github issue 12: https://github.com/offby1/rudybot/issues/12

** Ideas
- Prevent DOS.  Limit the total number of queued messages to something
  reasonable, as well as their size.  New messages push out older
  undelivered ones from the queue.
- The queues live in a dictionary keyed by nick, or better yet, some
  sort of canonicalized nick.  (canonicalize-nick in userinfo.rkt is
  probably the right thing)
- Every time rudybot sees a JOIN (or perhaps some other indication of
  someone signing on) he'll check the dict to see if there are any
  queued messages for that person
- Messages should include who sent 'em, and when
