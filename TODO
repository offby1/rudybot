* Roll the log file over
that is, don't let it grow without bound, but instead, once it gets to
a certain size, rename it and start a new file.

It might be easiest to invoke "multilog" from Dan Bernstein's
"daemontools" (http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/daemontools-0.76.tar.gz ;
available on Ubuntu 10.04 in the "daemontools" package)

* Get rid of "in/on" in the output of the "seen" command
surely I can figure out which preposition is appropriate.

https://github.com/offby1/rudybot/issues/23 says more or less the same
thing.

* Run with "--warn info"
... and fix the various lint-like warnings that come up

* Put the persistent data someplace safe
That's the big-log (which we mine for incubot-witticisms) and the
userinfo db.  I keep accidentally deleting them, and losing months of
accumulated data; they should be on S3 or something.

Someone suggested Dropbox; that could work!

* Incubot
** Publish the last few "logs"

For example, if someone says to him "you are clever" and he responds
"I have a clever idea", there'll be messages like "incubot chose
'clever'" in the log output ... make those messages accessible via
HTTP so that people can tell why he said what he said.

** A 'censor' command
defverb #:master (censor objectionable_words) ...

would eliminate rows in the incubot db that contain those words.

delete from log where rowid in ( select log_word_map.log_id from log_word_map where word in 
        ("Nasty", "nasty") );
delete from log_word_map where word in ("Nasty", "nasty") ;
delete from word_popularity where word in ("Nasty", "nasty") ;

Also note that this will leave ghosts in log_word_map -- references to
the deleted rows from "log".  This will nix those:

        DELETE FROM log_word_map
              WHERE log_id IN (
                 SELECT DISTINCT log_id 
                   FROM log_word_map 
              LEFT JOIN log 
                     ON log.rowid = log_word_map.log_id
          WHERE text IS NULL );

Note that such a command would be insanely dangerous; if I
accidentally typed "censor the", I'd lose most of the corpus, since
most log entries contain the word 'the'.

Further, nixing stuff manually from the DB isn't perfect; it'd be good
to then also nix it from the big-log; or (better) add some sort of
blacklist so that if I recreate the db from the log, those nasty
entries don't get re-added.

** Omit leading nicks from utterances
The original incubot does this.  E.g., if we find
: ":offby1!n=user@pdpc/supporter/monthlybyte/offby1 PRIVMSG #scheme :rudybot: seen eli"
in the log, then we currently reduce that to
: "rudybot: seen eli"
but we should really omit the leading nick and colon, yielding
: "seen eli"
That's because it looks odd for the bot to utter something that's
directed at someone who probably isn't present.
** Entirely omit, or at least trim, ACTION
I just saw the bot respond with "\1ACTION does something or other\1",
which was weird; it should have either said nothing, or else just
"does something or other".
** Use the same logic ...
... to initially create "parsed-log", as to add individual utterances
to it.

For example, I'm pretty sure I omit utterances that are addressed to
the bot, and begin with a command; i.e., when jordanb says "rudybot:
quote", I don't add that, since it'd be dull.

And yet when log-parser creates parsed-log, it blithely adds
everything.

** Rewrite "quote"

Eliminate the "quotes" database, and just have "quote" find some
random utternace by jordanb, and echo that.  I'm not saving the
speaker's name in the db, though; so it might not be possible to tell
what came from him.

A super-simple hacky way would be for "quote" to simply turn around
and do what "let's" would do.

** Underweight recent utterances

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
<jordanb> Offby1 should make a lolbot.
<offby1> already did
<jordanb> Heh
<jordanb> Have it join. ^_^
<jordanb> rudybot: lol
<rudybot> jordanb: lol
<jordanb> rudybot: lolbot                                                                                           [16:19]
<rudybot> jordanb: Offby1 should make a lolbot.
<jordanb> O                                                                                                         [16:21]
* offby1 makes a mental note to underweight recent utterances
<jordanb> I'm using emacs over X because it's less broken than tramp.

#+END_EXAMPLE
** Favor utterances whose target word appears early
Imagine we've chosen the word "enhance", and we find the the DB these two strings:
"Enhance your manhood with Presto Manhood Enlarger™"
"I would have preferred to enhance that with soup"

Those strings are about the same length, so the current code will
weight them about the same.  But there's something to be said for
giving the first one more weight, since when you read it, you see the
word earlier ... those examples I just gave above don't really
demonstrate the value, so let's take a real example:

: 2013-09-08T18:27:18Z incubot-server:incubot chose "enhance", which appears 117 times
: 2013-09-08T18:27:20Z => PRIVMSG #emacs :macrobat: how do I enable SLIME autocompletion in my lisp buffer? ideally using the auto-complete extension for a nice display of the completion options. I've installed ac-slime, but that only seems to enhance the auto-completion in my SLIME REPL, not the buffer in which I am editing my file.

That utterance is so long that you could die of boredom before getting
to the bit that uses the word "enhance".  _That_ is why we should
favor utterances where the word appears early.

* Replace minion

<jcowan> Having IRC-based messaging is very nice
<jcowan> I like phenny-style:  "rudybot: ask/tell <user> <message>", where the user is case insensitive
         and ignores underscores.

This is also github issue 12: https://github.com/offby1/rudybot/issues/12

** Ideas
- Prevent DOS.  Limit the total number of queued messages to something
  reasonable, as well as their size.  New messages push out older
  undelivered ones from the queue.
- The queues live in a dictionary keyed by nick, or better yet, some
  sort of canonicalized nick.  (canonicalize-nick in userinfo.rkt is
  probably the right thing)
- Every time rudybot sees a JOIN (or perhaps some other indication of
  someone signing on) he'll check the dict to see if there are any
  queued messages for that person
- Messages should include who sent 'em, and when

* Run as 'nobody' or some other user without permissions

This hopefully won't require a code change, but it'd be good if it
_didn't_ run as me, since if it did, it could conceivably read my
Sekrit files.
* Amend "quotes" list
... with e.g., http://www.cyber.com.au/~twb/fortunes/emacs.quip
